## Project Overview

**Azeno** is a fullâ€‘stack application built during the HackYeach marathon to collect, visualize and score road events that affect land transportation. The app provides global realâ€‘time mapping of incidents (accidents, roadblocks, delays, transport interruptions) and helps travelers plan safer, faster routes.

This repository contains both the **backend** (Python, FastAPI, Docker, SQLite) and the **frontend** (React + TypeScript). Performance, simplicity, and realâ€‘time UX were the main design goals.

## ðŸ”¥ Key Features

* **Global Incident Map** â€” visualize events worldwide with geolocation markers and heatmaps.
* **User Accounts** â€” register, login, and manage your profile.
* **Report Incidents** â€” users can report road events (accidents, closures, delays) with optional photos and metadata.
* **Realâ€‘time Route Overlay** â€” plan a route and see live disruptions along the path.
* **Scoring & Reputation** â€” users earn points for valid reports; LLM models help validate and score incoming reports.
* **AIâ€‘assisted Moderation & Enrichment** â€” incoming texts and reports are enriched and filtered by lightweight LLM pipelines to classify severity and detect spam or abuse.
* **Crossâ€‘platform UI** â€” runs in every modern browser, responsive and fast.

---

## Architecture & Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, Docker, SQLite for fast local prototyping
* **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite (or Create React App)
* **Maps & Visualization:** Leaflet / MapLibre (openâ€‘source), custom overlays
* **AI / LLM:** lightweight LLMs for text moderation, classification and enrichment of reports
* **Realâ€‘time layer:** WebSockets (FastAPI / Socket.IO compatible) for pushing live updates to clients
* **Auth:** JWT tokens (stateless), with endpoints for registration, login and profile

---



## API Highlights

**Auth**

* `POST /api/auth/register` â€” register new user
* `POST /api/auth/login` â€” returns JWT token

**Reports**

* `GET /api/reports` â€” list reports (filter by bbox, time, type)
* `POST /api/reports` â€” create a new incident (auth required)
* `GET /api/reports/{id}` â€” get single report details

**Realtime**

* WebSocket endpoint: `/ws/updates` â€” subscribe to live incident updates for a given bounding box or route


---

## How AI is used

* **Moderation:** Submitted text and images are scanned by LLM pipelines for profanity, disallowed content, and spam patterns.
* **Classification:** Reports are enriched with predicted severity, probable transport modes affected, and suggested tags.
* **Scoring:** A hybrid rule + ML system computes a score for each report to reward accurate contributors and reduce noise.

*Note:* AI components are designed to be modular â€” they can be swapped for remote APIs or local LLMs depending on deployment constraints.

## Contribution & Development Guidelines

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch: `feature/your-feature`.
2. Keep commits small and descriptive.
3. Write unit & integration tests for backend routes and frontend flows.
4. Linting: `eslint` + `prettier` for frontend, `ruff`/`flake8` for backend.
5. Open Pull Requests to `main` with a short description, testing steps and screenshots.

---

## Roadmap (short)

* Improve LLM models for better report validation
* Add offline map caching for lowâ€‘connectivity scenarios
* Introduce paid premium plan for advanced analytics and historical incident exports
